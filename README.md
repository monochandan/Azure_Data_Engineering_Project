# Azure_Data_Engineering_Project

The tools that are covered in this project are,

1. Azure Data Factory

2. Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

3. Azure Databricks

4. Azure Synapse Analytics

5. Azure Key vault

6. Azure Active Directory (AAD) and

7. Microsoft Power BI

   
The project's use case involves creating an end-to-end solution by using Azure Data Factory to ingest the tables from an on-premises SQL Server database and storing the data in Azure Data Lake. After the RAW data has been transformed into the cleanest possible form using Azure Databricks, the clean data is loaded into Azure Synapse Analytics, and Microsoft Power BI is integrated with Azure Synapse Analytics to create an interactive dashboard. In addition, we use Azure Key Vault and Azure Active Directory (AAD) for governance and monitoring.
